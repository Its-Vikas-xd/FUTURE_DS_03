# 🎓 FUTURE_DS_03 – College Event Feedback Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Data Science & Analytics Internship (Task 3)** with *Future Interns*.  
The goal is to **analyze student event feedback** collected via Google Forms to uncover satisfaction trends and provide actionable recommendations for future events.

We worked with two datasets containing rating-based and text-based feedback from various college events like workshops, seminars, and cultural activities.

## 📂 Dataset Information
We used **two datasets**:

1. **Student Feedback Dataset**  
   - Ratings for subject knowledge, concept clarity, presentation usage, assignment difficulty, doubt solving, course structure, and recommendation score.

2. **Student Satisfaction Survey Dataset**  
   - Overall satisfaction ratings and optional text comments about events.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
1. Checked dataset **shape** (rows & columns)
2. **Renamed columns** for clarity and simplicity
3. **Checked & handled missing values**
4. **Removed duplicate rows**
5. **Applied Label Encoding** to categorical columns

## 📊 Visualizations
- 📈 **Bar Chart** – Average rating for each feedback parameter
- 🥧 **Pie Chart** – Overall satisfaction distribution
- 🔥 **Heatmap** – Correlation between feedback parameters
- ☁ **Word Cloud** – Most frequent words in feedback comments
- 📊 **Sentiment Analysis** – Positive, Neutral, Negative distribution

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Most students rated **concept clarity** and **subject knowledge** highly.
- **Assignments** were considered slightly difficult by many students.
- Sentiment analysis showed **majority positive** feedback but with some suggestions for improvement.
- Word cloud highlighted frequent terms like *"helpful"*, *"interactive"*, and *"well-organized"*.
